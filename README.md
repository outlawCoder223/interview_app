# Interview Scheduler

## Welcome to Interview Scheduler!

Interview scheduler is a state of the art scheduling app that allows a user to schedule interviews with available mentors. This app utilizes React to create an impressive UI that is easy to use and also great to look at. Interview Scheduler is my first experience with React and I found it both fun and challenging to complete. One of my favorite parts of this project was writing the unit tests with Jest and also integrating Cypress to write an end-to-end test. Storybook was also great to build out my components in isolation and allowed me to bring all my components together quite easily. Take a browse through the screenshots or fork/clone it yourself! The development API is available at [scheduler_api](https://github.com/rancewcampbell/scheduler-api)
